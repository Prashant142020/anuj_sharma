                 Professor Anuj Sharma, Ph.D., FRSC, is a distinguished professor in the Department of Chemistry at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT Roorkee). He has over 20 years of research and teaching experience and expert in organic synthesis, green chemistry, mechanochemistry, and visible light photocatalysis.
                 Following his Ph.D. at CSIRâ€“Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, Dr. Sharma pursued coveted postdoctoral fellowships at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, and the University of Arizona, USA. His formative research improved the design of therapeutic molecules like anti-cancer and anti-malarial drugs immensely. He joined IIT Roorkee in 2011 and is now Professor of Chemistry.
